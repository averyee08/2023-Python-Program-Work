These are files of my Python projects from the Python summer program I did in 2023! I put together this Github for my 2024 NCWIT AiC High School Award Application.
Files include: a randomized "fighter game" I made where the user inputs stats for two characters and the randomizer determines which one will win, and
three versions of Tic-Tac-Toe. The first Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple player v. player game where two friends can play on one laptop. The second version is a
player v. computer game where the user inputs their position and the computer counters with a random position, but it is very easy to win. The third 
version is similar to the second, but it utilizes AI to guess the player's next move and make the game more challenging. I hope you enjoy my code!
